  <h1> Merge Sort</h1>

[MergeSort Program](https://github.com/AkashSingh3031/The-Complete-FAANG-Preparation/blob/master/1%5D.%20DSA/2%5D.%20Algorithms/02%5D.%20Sorting%20Algorithms/Java/MergeSort.java)

- It's One of the perfect example of a successful application of the Divide and Conquer Technique.
- It sorts the given array `A[0....n-1]` by Dividing it into two halves `A[0...(n/2)-1]` and `A[(n/2)....n-1]`.

## First let's write `MERGESORT`

# Algorithm: `MergeSort` `(A[0...n-1])`

> 1. Short array `A[0...n-1]` by recursive Merge Sort technique.
> 2. Input: An Array `A[0....n-1]` of orderable elements.
> 3. Output: Array `A[0....n-1]` sorted in Ascending order.

    if n>1
    Copy A[0.....(n/2)-1] to B[0...(n/2)-1].
    Copy A[(n-2)....n-1] to C[0....(n/2)-1].
    Mergesort (B[0...(n/2)-1])
    Mergesort (C[0...(n/2)-1])
    Megrge(B,C,A)

## Let's Crack It

- That's INPUT--> `B=[2,3,8,9]` and `C=[1,4,5,7]`

---

- Output --> `A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`

          Merge ( B=[0...p-1] , C=[0...q-1], A[0...p+q-1] );

        in `A[0...p+q-1]` 0 is index of Array, which start with 0, and `p+q` are the array last index of `B` and `C` array's List.
                i<-0; j<-0; k<-0;
                    while i<p and j<q do
                        if B[i] <= C[j]
                            A[k] <-B[i]; i<-i+1
                        else A[k] <-C[j]; j<-j+1
                        k<-k+1
                        if i=p
                            copy C[j....q-1] to A[k...p+q-1]
                        else
                            copy B[i...p-1] to A[k...p+q-1]

# Explanation

            Step 1 âˆ’ If it is only one element in the list it is already sorted, return.
            Step 2 âˆ’ Divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.
            Step 3 âˆ’ Merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.

  <h1>Quick Sort</h1>

[QuickSort Program](https://github.com/AkashSingh3031/The-Complete-FAANG-Preparation/blob/master/1%5D.%20DSA/2%5D.%20Algorithms/02%5D.%20Sorting%20Algorithms/Java/QuickSort.java)

- Quick Sort is another popular and widely-used Sorting Algorithm and is a well-suited example for Divide & Conquer Technique.
- Quick Sort approach divides it's input elements according to their value `(and not by according to their position as in case of Merge Sort)`.
- In particular Quick Sort algorithm/ technique rearranges elements of a given array `A[0...n-1]` to achieve its `partition`.

---

## Algorithm: `QuickSort (A[0...n-1])`

---

1.  Sorts a subarray by Quick Sort
2.  Input: A subarray `A[l....r]` of `A[0...n-1]` which is defined by its left and right indices(index) `l and r`.
3.  Output: A subarray `A[l...r]` sorted in an Ascending order.

        Pivot=A[0].. First element is pivot.
        i=l or 1.. left pointer.
        j=r or n-1.. right pointer.

---

        if l(left) < r(right)
        s<-partition(A[l...r]) // s is split position/pivot
        QuickSort(A[l...s-1])
        QuickSort(A[s+1...r])

        - PARTITION

        1. This Algorithm partitions (divides) a sub-array by using it's first element as pivot.
        2. Input: A sub-array A[l..r] of A[0...n-1] defined by its left and right indices(index) l and r (l<r).
        3. Output: A partition of A[l..r], with its split position i.e., a position for swap with pivot.

            pivot<-A[l]
            l<-l; j<-r+1

        ----<repeat
        |
        |    repeat i<-i+1 unitl A[i]>=pivot
        |    repeat j<-j-1 until A[j]<=pivot
        |    swap(A[i], A[j])
        |
        -----> until i>=j
           swap (A[i], A[j]) undo last swap when i>=j
           swap (A[l], A[j])
            return j

# Explanation

            Step 1 âˆ’ Choose the highest index value has pivot.
            Step 2 âˆ’ Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding  pivot.
            Step 3 âˆ’ left points to the low index.
            Step 4 âˆ’ right points to the high.
            Step 5 âˆ’ while value at left is less than pivot move right.
            Step 6 âˆ’ while value at right is greater than pivot move left.
            Step 7 âˆ’ if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right.
            Step 8 âˆ’ if left â‰¥ right, the point where they met is new pivot.

  <h1>Selection Sort</h1>

# SelectionSort Algorithm `(A[0...n-1], n)`

- Arranges element of given array into Ascending order b selection Sort.
- Input: An Array of `A[0...n-1]` of `n` element in unsorted order.
- Output: Array of `A[0...n-1]` sorted in Ascending order.

          for i<-0 to n-2 do
          min <-i
          for j<-(i+1) to (n-1) do // This loop is to find the Smallest
          element in the array.
          if A[j]<A[min] // true then
          min<-j //Position of Smallest element
          swap A[i] and A[min]
          temp<-A[i]
          A[i]<-A[min]
          A[min]<-temp

---

# Explanation

- In the Given Array `A[0...n-1]`, we start selection sort by scanning the entire array to find the smallest element and exchange it with the first elemnt i.e., `A[0]` keeping the smallest element in its final position in the sorted list.
- Further scan the array starting with the second element and find the smallest among the last `n-1` elements and exchange it with the second element i.e., `A[1]`, Keeping the second smallest element in it's final position in the sorted list.
- Like wise in each iteration, the unsorted array size minimises and partially sorted list increates. Therefore the name `Selection Sort` i.e., `Selecting The Smallest Element`.

  <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>

# BubbleSort Algorithm `(A[0...n-1])`

- Sorts a given array using Bubble Sort technique.
- Input: An Array of `A[0...n-1]` of `n` element.
- Output: Array of `A[0...n-1]` sorted in Ascending order.

          for i<-0 to n-2 do
            for j<-0 to n-2-i do.
               if A[j]>A[j+1] // true then
                  // swap A[j] <-> A[j+1]
               temp<-A[j]
               A[j]<-A[j+1]
               A[j+1]<-temp

---

# Explanation

- This algorithm compares adjacent elements of an array and swaps them if the element on the right is smaller than the one on the left`A[j]>A[j+1]`, then It Start Swaping. It is an in-place sorting algorithm i.e. no extra space is needed for this sort, the array itself is modified.
